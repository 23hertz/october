# Contributing to OctoberCMS

Your contributions to the project are very welcome. If you would like to fix a bug or propose a new feature, you can submit a Pull Request.

To help us merge your Pull Request, please make sure you follow these points:

1. Describe the problem clearly in the Pull Request description
1. Please make your fix on the `develop` branch. This makes merging much easier.
1. Do not edit compiled asset files such as `october.css` Instead, try to edit the LESS files inside the `less/` directory and then use a compiler.
1. For any change that you make, **please try to also add a test case(s)** in the `tests/unit` directory. This helps us understand the issue and make sure that it will stay fixed forever.

Thank you for your contributions!
